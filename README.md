# Staff-Salary-Calculator
JFrame App taking in an employees info which is their rate and how many hours they've worked that month then produces a report along with what they would pay after taxes.
In the app the 3 choices you have as what you do are: "cleaner", "lecturer" and "admin".
The tax rate is also not an accurate tax rate in real time it was just numbers I used. 

I used classes and JFrame in this activity.
This is part of my Java Journey.
